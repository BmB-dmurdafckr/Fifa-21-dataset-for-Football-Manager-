# Fifa-21-dataset-for-Football-Manager-

Analysis the Fifa 21 dataset to have an overview of better young players relatively unknown for my Football Manager team. 

It's my sixth year playing Football Manager, decided to apply my datascience skills to build a formidable team with a superflous of talented relatively unknown young players for little, then flipped for a greater amount upon development. 

Also, we get a sense of countries where we can focus our scouting prowess on for those particular set of talents. This would aid in improving the team in game continental and financial success.

The Fifa 21 dataset can be used for numerous things relatable to the reality of football. However, I decided to limit mine to a video game.
